                        <p>
                            The tarot were originally a deck of 78 playing cards dating back to the 14th century that evolved into a divination tool appearing in the late 18th century. The images in the tarot contain rich complex allegories that relate to conditions, archetypes and aspects of human life. By pairing intuition with the images of the tarot, the user can gain subconscious information that may provide favorable outcomes in life.
